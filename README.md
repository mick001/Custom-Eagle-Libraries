# Custom Eagle Libraries

This is a repository where I store a library of footprints of components I could not find anywhere else.

You'll see that the components are designed quite simply without too many details. These are my first custom made footprints so don't be harsh in evaluating them :)

So far, the following components are included:

- SDSZ-12VDC-SL relay (Note: this component has apparently a wrong footprint on the manufacturer's data sheet, please double check your relay before manufacturing the PCB).
- ACP-SPAIN-22k potentiometer
- 2 pin connector outlet for connecting load/source (there's no part number available for this).
